contract MyContract {
    string public myString = "Hello world"; 

    function updateOurString(string memory _myString) public {
        myString = _myString;
    }
}


The contract is like a class. 
you declare a variable and public makes it interactive
The method updateOurString will be interactive, it ask for input _myString, also note that when you use strings in as arguments
string and  memory are required to be in front before you use it.
